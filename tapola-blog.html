								<p>The Mini Kashmir of Maharashtra</p>
								<h2>Tapola</h2>

							<p> Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet!
							  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
							<p>The verse from Ballad of East and West by Rudyard Kipling seems to fit when it comes to human and Mother Nature; especially in the untouched Ghats of India. During vacations where you would like to go? The crowded place or a place where you can have a peace of mind? Of course for the peace of mind! But where? People residing in Mumbai or Pune often opt for Mahabaleshwar which is 3-4hrs away from their living proximity, which is actually a good place to be with your family or friends. When you reach there, things don’t seem to be so as mentioned in the internet sites. There is a sense of betrayal by the internet which mentions just about the scenes, nearby locations etc. But nowhere mentions about the huge influx of tourists and overcrowded places. Why I am telling you all about Mahabaleshwar when the heading says- TAPOLA? Don’t be mad at me, I’m arriving there…
							  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
							<p>You really want to spend few days isolated from human settlements? Enjoy the nature at its best, tents stay and hike in the reserved forest? Then, the best place to visit is just 30Kms away from Mahabaleshwar named TAPOLA which is also referred as mini-Kashmir of Maharashtra. The journey to this location is full of twists and turns but this won’t distract you from enjoying the breathtaking views. If you are lucky enough then you can spot tiger or a leopard wandering in the forest. But need not to worry at all, they stay away from human settlements. Once you reach there, you can find plenty of options for stay and exotic Maharashtrian styled dishes. The region is partially surrounded by Koyna river and people often use boats for transportation. If you really want to enjoy your stay at TAPOLA, then pack your bags and grab some portable tent and go for riverside stay in this region. Light a camp fire, roast potatoes or Maggie and enjoy the star gazing. The sunrise and sunset scenes are like a bumper offer for the photographers who are keen in capturing landscapes. Ensure that your pockets have some weight it in, go for a boat safari which covers around 3 places and a Vasota Fort situated in the Koyna Natural Reserve which takes aound 2 ½ hours by boat and an hour on foot (there is no roadways to reach this point) which costs around Rs 5000 for a group of 4 members. Come back to the village and enjoy some roasted freshwater fishes. Residents of this village are really friendly and helping in nature. Last thing- you will face a network problem, which anyways is an advantage for you to be isolated from your routine and monotonous work.</p>
